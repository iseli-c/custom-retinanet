# Customised implementation of pytorch-retinanet


Pytorch  implementation of RetinaNet object detection as described in [Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.02002) by Tsung-Yi Lin, Priya Goyal, Ross Girshick, Kaiming He and Piotr Doll√°r.


## Installation

1) Clone this repo

2) Install the required packages:

```
apt-get install tk-dev python-tk
```

3) Install the python packages:
	
```
pip install cffi

pip install pandas

pip install pycocotools

pip install cython

pip install opencv-python

pip install requests

```

4) Build the NMS extension.

```
cd pytorch-retinanet/lib
bash build.sh
cd ../
```

Note that you may have to edit line 14 of `build.sh` if you want to change which version of python you are building the extension for.

## Training



## Pre-trained model

A pre-trained model is available at: 
- https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yLmjq3JtXi841yXWBxst0coAgR26MNBS (this is a pytorch state dict)
- https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hCtM35R_t6T8RJVSd74K4gB-A1MR-TxC (this is a pytorch model serialized via `torch.save()`)

The state dict model can be loaded using:

```
retinanet = model.resnet50(num_classes=dataset_train.num_classes(),)
retinanet.load_state_dict(torch.load(PATH_TO_WEIGHTS))
```

The pytorch model can be loaded directly using:

```
retinanet = torch.load(PATH_TO_MODEL)
```


## Model

The retinanet model uses a resnet backbone. You can set the depth of the resnet model using the --depth argument. Depth must be one of 18, 34, 50, 101 or 152. Note that deeper models are more accurate but are slower and use more memory.


### Class mapping format
The class name to ID mapping file should contain one mapping per line.
Each line should use the following format:
```
class_name,id
```

Indexing for classes starts at 0.
Do not include a background class as it is implicit.

For example:
```
cow,0
cat,1
bird,2
```
